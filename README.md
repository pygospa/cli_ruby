# Purpose of this repository

This repository holds the notes I made while reading the book 
[Build Awesome Command-Line Applications in Ruby 2](http://pragprog.com/book/dccar2/build-awesome-command-line-applications-in-ruby-2)
by [David Bryant Copeland](http://www.naildrivin5.com/). This book was kindly
provided to me by [O'Reilly Germany](http://www.oreilly.de/) so that I could write a
recension for the [Hackerspace
Bremen e.V.](https://www.hackerspace-bremen.de://www.hackerspace-bremen.de/). 

When finished, the final version of the recension will be found at the bottom
of my [member page](https://www.hackerspace-bremen.de/author/pygospa/) (unfortunately only in German).
