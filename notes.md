#Introduction (vii - ix)

The author divides the world into a pre- and a post-Java world, with the pre-Java world being dominated by single-purpose, easy-to-use portable and combinable, yet hard-to-learn CLI tools, and sees Java being the main reason for the introduction of GUI tools as programmers power-tools for complex, real-world tasks.
The CLI since then was pushed back and only used for automation of repetetive tasks and only rediscovered by Ruby and Rails wich use powerful CLI tools that realize tasks that are unsuitable for GUIs, proofing that CLIs are more than just "one-off hacky scripts" (p. viii).
Copeland divides CLI tools into "two main styles of app: a simple UNIX-like style and the more complex 'command-suite' style as exemplified by commands like `git` or `gem`"
